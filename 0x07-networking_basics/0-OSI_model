What is the OSI model?

The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication 
functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their 
underlying internal structure and technology.

How is the OSI model organized?

The OSI model is organized from the lowest to the highest level. 
It segments the communication process into seven layers, 
each with its designated functions and responsibilities, 
from the physical transmission level (Layer 1) 
to the application-specific communication level (Layer 7).
